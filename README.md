# Hangman Game
Welcome to the Hangman game! This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic word-guessing game where players try to guess a word by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. 
# Features
Randomly selects a word from a predefined list.
Displays the current state of the word with underscores for unguessed letters.
Provides visual feedback with hangman stages.
Tracks the number of incorrect guesses and remaining lives.
Option to play multiple rounds.
Make sure that you have the HANGMAN_ELEMENTS module with the necessary elements (logo, word_list, stages, game_over).
# How to Play
The game will randomly select a word from the list.
You will see a series of underscores representing the letters in the word.
Enter a letter to guess. If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed; otherwise, you lose a life.
The game continues until you either guess the word or run out of lives.
After each game, you can choose to play again or exit.
